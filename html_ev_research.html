        We track odds from various online sportsbooks to identify mispriced markets that can lead to profitable outcomes when consistently wagered over time—commonly referred to as positive expected value (+EV) bets. Use our tool below to find currently available +EV bets, and explore more about the mechanics of +EV betting in the following sections.

        <h3>How Our Positive EV Bets Tool Works</h3>
        <p>Our Positive EV (Expected Value) tool scans online sportsbooks for mispriced odds to identify bets that can return a profit over time. By constantly monitoring odds every minute, we ensure you find currently available +EV bets today.</p>

        <h4>How It Works:</h4>
        <p>To find a +EV bet, consider this example: If most sportsbooks offer the New York Yankees to win at -130 odds, but one offers them at -105, we assume -130 is the correct price. This makes the -105 odds a better value.</p>
        <p>However, simply spotting better odds doesn't make a bet +EV. It must also overcome the "vig" or "juice" that sportsbooks charge. For example, if -130 is the correct price for the Yankees, and the no-vig fair odds come out to -119, getting -105 is a positive expected value, meaning you're getting a great deal.</p>

        <h4>Using the Tool:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Event:</strong> Displays the game details (league, date, time).</li>
            <li><strong>+EV Bet:</strong> Shows the bet offering +EV and the sportsbook offering it.</li>
            <li><strong>Consensus No Vig Odds:</strong> Reflects the odds with the vig removed.</li>
            <li><strong>+EV Bet Odds:</strong> Directly links you to the sportsbook with the +EV bet.</li>
            <li><strong>ROI:</strong> Displays the long-term expected return based on the bet odds and consensus no-vig odds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can filter by league (NFL, NBA, etc.) and state to find +EV bets available in your area.</p>

        <h4>What is Expected Value (EV)?</h4>
        <p>Expected value (EV) measures how much a bet is expected to return, typically shown as a percentage. While most bets have negative EV due to the vig, +EV bets are those with a higher expected return than the sportsbook implies. Over time, consistently betting +EV can lead to a profit.</p>

        <h4>Understanding No-Vig Odds:</h4>
        <p>No-vig odds are the true odds with no sportsbook cut. For example, instead of -110 on both sides of a market, no-vig odds would be +100 on each side, reflecting the true 50/50 probability. By comparing current odds with no-vig odds, you can spot +EV opportunities.</p>

        <p>In short, our tool does the hard work of finding these bets by comparing odds across sportsbooks, saving you the effort of manually checking multiple sites.</p>

        <h4>Calculating Return on Investment (ROI) for Sports Betting</h4>
        <p>To calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) for sports betting using the consensus no-vig odds and your +EV bet, you can follow these steps:</p>

        <h5>Formula for ROI</h5>
        <div class="formula">
            ROI = (Total Profit / Total Stake) × 100
        </div>

        <h5>Steps to Calculate ROI</h5>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Determine Your Bet Amount:</strong> Let's say you are betting $100.</li>
            <li><strong>Find the Consensus No-Vig Odds:</strong> For example, if the consensus no-vig odds are +250, this means that for every $100 wagered, you would win $250.</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate Potential Profit from Your Bet:</strong>
                <div class="formula">
                    Potential Profit = (Consensus No-Vig Odds / 100) * Bet Amount
                </div>
                <p>Example: If your no-vig odds are +250, potential profit = (250 / 100) * 100 = $250.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calculate the Expected Value (EV):</strong>
                <div class="formula">
                    EV = (Probability of Winning * Potential Profit) - (Probability of Losing * Bet Amount)
                </div>
                <p>You'll need to estimate the probability of winning. For instance, if you believe you have a 40% chance of winning, your EV would be:</p>
                <p>EV = (0.40 * 250) - (0.60 * 100) = $100 - $60 = $40.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calculate Total Profit:</strong>
                <p>Total Profit = EV (if the bet wins) or -Bet Amount (if the bet loses).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you win: Total Profit = $250 - $100 = $150.</li>
                    <li>If you lose: Total Profit = -$100.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calculate ROI:</strong>
                <p>Use the ROI formula from Step 2.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the bet wins: ROI = ($150 / $100) * 100 = 150%.</li>
                    <li>If the bet loses: ROI = (-$100 / $100) * 100 = -100%.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p>Let's summarize with an example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bet Amount: $100</li>
            <li>Consensus No-Vig Odds: +250</li>
            <li>Probability of Winning: 40%</li>
            <li>Potential Profit = $250</li>
            <li>EV = (0.40 * 250) - (0.60 * 100) = $40</li>
            <li>If you win: ROI = ($150 / $100) * 100 = 150%.</li>
            <li>If you lose: ROI = (-$100 / $100) * 100 = -100%.</li>
        </ul>
